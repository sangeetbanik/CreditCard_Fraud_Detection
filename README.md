# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## üìù Introduction 
A fictional credit card company, Company ABC, is struggling with their current fraud detection system. In this project, I am working as a financial analyst, whom the company hired to spot and flag suspicious transactions for further review. I will follow various data analysis process like:<ins> data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data and model training and evaluation</ins>.

## üí¨ Background
Company ABC, a fictional company credit cards, is struggling with their current fraud detection system. It faces challenges with their existing fraud detection system and is slow to catch new fraud patterns, which has been costing them a lot of money. To fix this, they've hired us to create an algorithm that can quickly spot and flag suspicious transactions for further review. They've given us two datasets to work with: cc_info, which has general info about credit cards and their users, and transactions, which includes details of all credit card transactions made between August 1st and October 30th.

## ‚öô Approach/Steps
**Business Task -**
The goal of this project is to create a smart fraud detection system using neural networks to spot unusual or suspicious transactions. We‚Äôll use object-oriented programming (OOP) to build a solution that's scalable, easy to manage, and capable of handling large amounts of data while giving useful insights to Company ABC.

**Data Sets -**
We have two files in our datasets , **cc_info.csv** and **transactions.csv**, which are described below:-

Here is the column description for *cc_info.csv*<br>

|------------------   | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| credit_cad          | Unique identifier for each transaction.                                      |
